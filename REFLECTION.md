After finishing this assignment, I now have a better understanding of Git and Github. At first I had trouble since this was new to me, but as I followed the assignments instructions it began to become clear to me how git works and how it translates data to Github. Github to me can be described as the storage for our code, we use git to log our code 
and it directs it to the Github site. I can imagine how useful this method can be, especially for larger projects that are worked on by teams, it's very easy to separate data in a clear organized manner with the ability to label and separate. Some trouble I had was in Git Bash itself, often my commands were not showing up on my repository, but
I used some outside resources such as youtube videos to explain what was going on. All in all I am way more comfortable using git and github and understand why it's used.
